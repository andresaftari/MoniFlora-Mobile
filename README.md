# MoniFlora Mobile
Thank you for trying out Moniflora Mobile!

This app is part of my thesis project, and its primary objective is to facilitate the development of a condition monitoring app that leverages machine learning models and data analysis techniques to predict plant health assessment.

## Key Features:
**1. Real-Time Condition Monitoring:** Monitor the health and conditions of your plants in real-time.
**2. Machine Learning Integration:** Utilize advanced machine learning models to assess plant health.
**3. Data Analysis:** Analyze data to predict potential issues and optimize plant care.

## Additional Resources:
For more information about the dataset and machine learning model examples used in this app, check out the [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andresaftari/moniflora-backup-rtdb/data).
